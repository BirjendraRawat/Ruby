# Deaf grandma extended. What if Grandma doesnâ€™t want you to leave?
# When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear you. Change your
# previous program so that you have to shout BYE three times in a row. Make
# sure to test your program: if you shout BYE three times but not in a row,
# you should still be talking to Grandma.
