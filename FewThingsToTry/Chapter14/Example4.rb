# English number. Write a method named english_number. Itâ€™ll take an integer,
# like 22, and return the English version of it (in this case, the string "twenty-
# two"). To start, have it handle only integers from 0 to 100. Then add the
# ability to handle larger numbers, so that a thousand becomes "ten hundred"
# and a million becomes "one hundred hundred hundred". The key is to use
# recursion.
# Now expand upon english_number. First, put in thousands; it should return
# "one thousand" instead of "ten hundred" and "ten thousand" instead of "one hundred
# hundred".
# Then add millions, so you get "one million" instead of "one thousand thousand".
# Then add billions, trillions, and any other -illions you want to add.
